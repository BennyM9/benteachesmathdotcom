<p>Before diving too deep into any of them, I want to talk about the <a href="https://www.synapseschool.org/middle-school/middle-school-program">HEARTS model</a> for curriculum, project, and lesson design. Created at Synapse School, the model contains 6 phases: Heat, Engage, Activate, Reflect, Transform, and Store. I like to think of HEARTS as a fractal: it works for an individual lesson, for a project, or even an entire semester or school year. To learn about the cannonical model, definitely read the link above, but here it is in my words:</p>
<p><strong>HEAT</strong><br />
While most of the work of learning happens in the cognitive world of the mind, warming up the body first can go a long way. Starting a lesson or project in the physical world primes students' minds for learning.</p>
<p><strong>ENGAGE</strong><br />
This is the "opening scene" of a project or lesson. Much like the first scene in a book or movie, it sets the tone and generates intrigue so that the audience is eager to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIVATE</strong><br />
Capitalizing on the Engage page, Activate introduces low-floor, high-cieling work that encourages students to construct their own understanding. This is where new concepts are introduced, and students create new problem solving tools.</p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong><br />
For many students, the Activate phase can be intense and sometimes confusing. Here, we take time to Reflect on new knoweldge, spiral back on key concepts, and ensure students "know what they know" by creating consistent definitions, and reviewing methods.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSFORM</strong><br />
What good is new knowledge if we don't actually do anything with it?! This phase is all about changing the context of learning, transforming new concepts or skills into something meaningful and real.</p>
<p><strong>STORE</strong><br />
Ultimately, all of this needs to make its way into long-term memory where it can be recalled and used in new contexts. In the Store phase, students seal their understanding by articulating what they've learned.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
