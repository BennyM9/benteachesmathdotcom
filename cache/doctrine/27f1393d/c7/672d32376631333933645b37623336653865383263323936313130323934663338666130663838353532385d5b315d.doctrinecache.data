<p>How can we build a visual intuition for algebraic representation?</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p><a href="https://bhi61nm2cr3mkdgk1dtaov18-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Border-Problem-final-copy.pdf">The Border Problem</a> is a classic from <a href="https://www.youcubed.org/">YouCubed</a>, and one of my favorite ways to start a unit on algebra because it promotes rich dialogue, creates a need for students to devise new tools and methods of representation, and is a great activity for setting norms in the classroom.</p>

<h5>Heat &amp; Engage</h5>
<p>To kick off this lesson, challenge the students to determine how many red squares are in this figure without counting... but they'll only have a few seconds to view it before it disappears!<br />
