<p>What would a fourth spatial dimension look and feel like? How can we build intuition for the fourth dimension by coupling mathematical reasoning with technology and tools?

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>While running my <a href="https://benteachesmath.com/projects & lessons/illustrating-flatland">Illustrating Flatland</a> elective in the fall of 2019, I dove headfirst into the world of higher dimensional geometry, trying to build a spatial intuition for some of its simplest shapes, and applying that intuition and some mathematical logic to wrap my head around more complex objects, as well as higher dimensions. It was so fun and engaging, that I had to bring my students along for the ride- hence a new Friday elective: Journey to the Fourth Dimension.    </p>
<h4>Breaking it Down</h4>
<p>Rather than strictly following the HEARTS model for the full trimester, I structured this elective in "episodes" as students embarked on this epic journey into the heady world of higher dimensional geometry. Each episode loosely followed HEARTS.</p>
<h5>Episode One: Pilot</h5>
<p><img alt="" src="/user/pages/02.Projects & Lessons/journey-to-the-fourth-dimension/J4D baby.png" /><br />
Episode One was dedicated to open play and exploration. Students were encouraged to imagine themselves as 4D babies playing with blocks. Much like a real baby builds an intuition for space through interacting with toys, such as trying to fit a round (cylindrical) block into a square hole vs a circular hole, the app <a href="https://4dtoys.com/">4D Toys</a> (where much of the artwork on this page comes from) enables this kind of free exploration of 4D objects.</p>
<h5>Episode Two: You Are Here</h5>
<p>Before setting our sights on the destination of sublime fourth dimensional understanding, we had to get our bearings. In Episode Two: You Are Here, we oriented ourselves in 3D space by breaking down what a dimension is in the first place. We did this through looking at the world through Super Mario's eyes. We started with a video of a <a href="https://youtu.be/-avspZlbOWU?t=9">playthrough of level 1-1 in Super Mario Bros for SNES</a>.<br />
We then looked at a SNES controller, and did a notice/wonder session, with students observing that the controler only has four directional buttons: up, down, left and right. This led to a collective agreement as a class that Super Mario is a 2D game, because Mario only has freedom of movement in two directions: vertical and horizontal.<br />

At this point, I introduced students to a new vocabulary word: orthogonal. We then explored how, if Mario could move "in and out," a new direction orthogonal to both vertical <em>and</em> horizontal, he would be 3D, like us. I left the students with the cliffhanger question of "what direction is orthogonal to all 3 of those dimensions?"</p>
<h5>Episode Three: Choose Your Weapon, part 1 - The Warrior</h5>
<p><img alt="" src="/user/pages/02.Projects & Lessons/journey-to-the-fourth-dimension/J4D Choose Your Weapon.png" /><br />
The next two episodes focus on two tools for bringing higher dimensional objects down to lower dimensions, presented through two characters: The Warrior &amp; The Wizard (credit to my former student, Cole for this awesome artwork!).<br />
The Warrior brings higher dimensional objects down a level by slicing them with her magical sword, creating cross sections. Rather than going full Fruit Ninja, however, students were given plastic knives and a glob of Play Dough, and encouraged to figure out all the different shapes that can be made by slicing a cube. It wasn't particularly precise, so the next time I run this episode, I'm going to try to do it with better tools.<br />
After spending most of the class playing with knives, we closed out with a question about how this concept might extrapolate to slicing 4D objects. Students had a lot of great conjectures, and one even posited that a 4D shape could intersect a "slice" of 3D space! We then tied this idea to their explorations of the 4D Toys app in Episode One.    </p>
<h5>Episode Four: Choose Your Weapon, part 2 - The Wizard</h5>
<p>While The Warrior uses a sword to slice objects down to a lower dimension, The Wizard uses magical light beams to cast shadows of higher dimensions down into a lower dimension. In this class, we took a field trip to a classroom with no windows, where we turned off the lights and use a projector to look at the different shadows we could cast with 3D objects. By rotating a cube, how many different shapes could we make? How did they compare to the shapes we got by slicing?<br />
Probably my favorite of these demonstrations was with a wireframe cube made from <a href="https://www.zometool.com/">Zome</a>. One of the faces was covered with a translucent plastic, so that we could see what happened to that particular face as the cube was rotated, showing as it transformed from a </p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
