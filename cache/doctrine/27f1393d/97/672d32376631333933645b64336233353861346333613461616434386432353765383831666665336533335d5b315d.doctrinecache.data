<p>What would a fourth spatial dimension look and feel like? How can we build intuition for the fourth dimension by coupling mathematical reasoning with technology and tools?</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>While running my <a href="https://benteachesmath.com/projects & lessons/illustrating-flatland">Illustrating Flatland</a> elective in the fall of 2019, I dove headfirst into the world of higher dimensional geometry, trying to build a spatial intuition for some of its simplest shapes, and applying that intuition and some mathematical logic to wrap my head around more complex objects, as well as higher dimensions. It was so fun and engaging, that I had to bring my students along for the ride- hence a new Friday elective: Journey to the Fourth Dimension.    </p>
<h4>Breaking it Down</h4>
<p>Rather than strictly following the HEARTS model, I structured this elective in "episodes"</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
