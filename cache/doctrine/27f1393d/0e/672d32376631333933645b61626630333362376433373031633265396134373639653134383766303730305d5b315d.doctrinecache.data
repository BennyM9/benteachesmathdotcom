<p>What would a fourth spatial dimension look and feel like? How can we build intuition for the fourth dimension by coupling mathematical reasoning with technology and tools?

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>While running my <a href="https://benteachesmath.com/projects & lessons/illustrating-flatland">Illustrating Flatland</a> elective in the fall of 2019, I dove headfirst into the world of higher dimensional geometry, trying to build a spatial intuition for some of its simplest shapes, and applying that intuition and some mathematical logic to wrap my head around more complex objects, as well as higher dimensions. It was so fun and engaging, that I had to bring my students along for the ride- hence a new Friday elective: Journey to the Fourth Dimension.    </p>
<h4>Breaking it Down</h4>
<p>Rather than strictly following the HEARTS model for the full trimester, I structured this elective in "episodes" as students embarked on this epic journey into the heady world of higher dimensional geometry. Each episode loosely followed HEARTS.</p>
<h5>Episode One: Pilot</h5>

Episode One was dedicated to open play and exploration. Students were encouraged to imagine themselves as 4D babies playing with blocks. Much like a real baby builds an intuition for space through interacting with toys, such as trying to fit a round (cylindrical) block into a square hole vs a circular hole, the app <a href="https://4dtoys.com/">4D Toys</a> (where much of the artwork on this page comes from) enables this kind of free exploration of 4D objects.</p>
<h5>Episode Two: You Are Here</h5>
<p>Before setting our sights on the destination of sublime fourth dimensional understanding, we had to get our bearings. In Episode Two: You Are Here, we oriented ourselves in 3D space by breaking down what a dimension is in the first place. We did this through looking at the world through Super Mario's eyes. We started with a video of a playthrough of level 1-1 in Super Mario Bros for SNES:    </p>
