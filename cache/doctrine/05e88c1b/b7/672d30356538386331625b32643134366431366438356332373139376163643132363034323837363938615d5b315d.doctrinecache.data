<p>Before diving too deep into any of them, I want to talk about the <a href="https://www.synapseschool.org/middle-school/middle-school-program">HEARTS model</a>, a Synapse School original, for curriculum, project, and lesson design. The model contains 6 phases: Heat, Engage, Activate, Reflect, Transform, and Store. I like to think of these phases, and the model overall, as having a fractal nature: it works for an individual lesson, for a project, or even an entire semester or school year. For the cannonical model, definitely read the link above, but here is the process in my own words:</p>
<p><strong>HEAT</strong>
blah</p>
<p><strong>ENGAGE</strong>
blah</p>
<p><strong>ACTIVATE</strong>
blah</p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong>
blah</p>
<p><strong>TRANSFORM</strong>
blah</p>
<p><strong>STORE</strong>
blah</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
