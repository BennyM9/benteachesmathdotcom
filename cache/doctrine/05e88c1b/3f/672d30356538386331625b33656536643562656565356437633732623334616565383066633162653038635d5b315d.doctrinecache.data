<p>How can we bring art, color, and spunk to the book "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions"?</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This is a class I ran as a Friday elective in partnership with Britnei, one of the art teachers at Synapse School. The book Flatland is a classic mathematical novella about a square living in a two dimensional world where the number of sides an inhabitant has determines their place in the social order. It is meant to satirize Victorian culture through a rigorously mathematical metaphor. It is part of the public domain, and free to read and use from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97">Project Gutenberg</a>. In the elective, students read the book, and then created artwork based on their favorite scenes. The ultimate goal is to have enough artwork to create and print a picture book of Flatland!</p>
