a:2:{s:7:"content";s:1982:"<p>Over the course of my (albieit short) teaching career, I have borrowed, liberated, pilfered, resurrected, found, created or otherwise procured many most excellent lessons and projects for my classroom. The posts herein contain descriptions of some of my favorites.</p>
<p>Before diving too deep into any of them, I want to talk about the <a href="https://www.synapseschool.org/middle-school/middle-school-program">HEARTS model</a> for curriculum, project, and lesson design. Designed at Synapse School, the model contains 6 phases: Heat, Engage, Activate, Reflect, Transform, and Store. I like to think of HEARTS as a fractal: it works for an individual lesson, for a project, or even an entire semester or school year. To learn about the cannonical model, definitely read the link above, but here is the process in my own words:</p>
<p><strong>HEAT</strong>
While most of the work of learning happens in the cognitive world of the mind, warming up the body first can go a long way. Starting a lesson or project in the physical world primes students' minds for learning.</p>
<p><strong>ENGAGE</strong>
This is the "opening scene" of a project or lesson. Much like the first scene in a book or movie, it sets the tone and generates intrigue so that the audience is eager to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIVATE</strong>
The Activate phase is where we capitalize on student engagement by introducing them to problems or concepts that challenge their current understanding. Through low-floor, high-cieling lessons that meet a student where they are, they are encouraged to synthesize concepts, seek out new tools, and otherwise actively learn through experience.</p>
<p><strong>REFLECT</strong>
For many students, the Activate phase can be intense and full of cognitive dissonance. Here, we take time to Reflect on our new knoweldge, spiral back on key concepts, and ensure students "know what they know."</p>
<p><strong>TRANSFORM</strong>

<p><strong>STORE</strong>
