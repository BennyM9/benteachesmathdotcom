<p>How can we bring art, color, and spunk to the book "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions"?</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This is a class I ran as a Friday elective in partnership with Britnei, one of the art teachers at Synapse School. Flatland is a classic mathematical novella written in 1884 about a square living in a two dimensional world where the number of sides an inhabitant has determines their place in the social order. The social dynamics of Flatland matter greatly to our square, until he is visited by a sphere from the 3rd Dimension. It is meant to satirize Victorian culture through a rigorously mathematical metaphor. It is part of the public domain, and free to read and use from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97">Project Gutenberg</a>. In the elective, students read the book, and then created artwork of their favorite scenes and characters. The ultimate goal is to have enough artwork to create and print a picture book of Flatland!</p>
<h4>Heat &amp; Engage</h4>
<p>In a 2D world, everything looks like just a straight line. From the top, a piece of paper may be a rectangle, but when viewed from the plane of the paper, it is just a thin line. The Heat and Engage for this project came from a demonstration of that concept, followed by a question: If you were an inhabitant of a flat universe, how would you figure out what shape your friends were?<br />
The book goes into excruciating detail about how citizens of Flatland determine what shape each other is by "feeling" their angles. Since most of the shapes are regular, knowing the size of someone's angle tells you what shape they are! To engage our bodies at the start of the elective, each student was given a slip of paper, either with a shape on it, or an angle matching one of the shapes. Without revealing their shape or angle, students had to find the person that matched. For example, if your paper had a 120ยบ angle, you would try to find the person with a hexagon. It was a fun way to get the kids moving, thinking about the relationships between angles and regular polygons, and socializing with each other, especially since the class had 5th-8th graders.</p>
<h4>Activate</h4>
<p>In the Activate phase, students read Flatland for homework, and we spent class time discussing the reading, exploring the story itself, and the math that supports it. Students learned about what a dimension really means, some facts about regular polygons, and the idea of slicing with a plane to make cross-sections.<br />

This phase involved some of my favorite discussions with students of my whole career. One student brought up the way the author handled women in Flatland, who are represented as 1D lines with no brains. This lead to a debate about whether the sexism was an intentional move by the author in his critique of Victorian culture, or a genuine manifestation of that very sexism. Ultimately, there was no way to be sure, but the students all agreed that women deserve better treatment in the book (more on this later).<br />
Another great outcome of this phase was the curiosity it piqued in both my students and me to learn more about the idea of four dimensional geometry! Students asked really deep questions and conducted independent research to learn more. One student </p>
