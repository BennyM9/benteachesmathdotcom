#### ## Essential Question
How can we bring art and color to the book "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions"?    
![](Screen%20Shot%202021-01-10%20at%2012.32.06%20AM.png?cropResize=300,300)

#### ## Overview
This is a class I ran as a Friday elective in the all of 2019 in partnership with Britnei, one of the art teachers at Synapse School. Flatland is a classic mathematical novella written in 1884 about a square living in a two dimensional world where the number of sides an inhabitant has determines their place in the societal hierarchy. The social dynamics of Flatland matter greatly to our square, until he is visited by a sphere from the 3rd Dimension and shown the deeper nature of reality.    
It is meant to satirize Victorian culture through a rigorous mathematical metaphor. It is part of the public domain, and free to read and use from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97). In the elective, students read the book, and then created artwork of their favorite scenes and characters. The ultimate goal is to have enough artwork to create and print a picture book of Flatland!

#### ## HEARTS

##### ###### Heat & Engage
In a 2D world, everything looks like just a straight line. From the top, a piece of paper may seem a rectangle, but when viewed from the plane of the paper, it is just a thin line. The Heat and Engage for this project came as a pair. First, students each used a piece of paper of their own to convince themselves that determining the shape of a piece of paper is impossible when viewed "from the plane." Then, I followed with a question: If you were an inhabitant of a flat universe, how would you figure out what shape your friends were?    
The book goes into excruciating detail about how citizens of Flatland determine what shape each other is by "feeling" their angles. Since most of the shapes are regular, knowing the size of someone's angle tells you what shape they are! To engage our bodies at the start of the elective, each student was given a slip of paper, either with a shape on it, or an angle matching one of the shapes. Without revealing their shape or angle, students had to move about the classroom to find the person that matched. For example, if your paper had a 120ยบ angle, you would try to find the person with a hexagon. It was a fun way to get the kids moving, thinking about the relationships between angles and regular polygons, and socializing with each other, especially since the class was mixed-level, ranging from 5th-8th graders.

##### ###### Activate
In the Activate phase, students read Flatland for homework, and we spent class time discussing the reading, exploring the story itself, and the math that supports it. Students learned about what a dimension really means, some facts about regular polygons, and the idea of slicing with a plane to make cross-sections.

This phase also involved some great classroom discourse. One student brought up the way the author included women in Flatland, who are represented as 1D line segments, unable to participate in many elements of the 2D society. This lead to a debate about whether the sexism was an intentional move by the author in his critique of Victorian culture, or a genuine manifestation of that very sexism. Ultimately, there was no way to be sure, but the students all agreed that women deserve better treatment in the book (more on this later).    
Another great outcome of this phase was the curiosity it piqued in both my students and me to learn more about the idea of four dimensional geometry! Students asked really deep questions and conducted independent research to learn more. One student introduced the class to my new favorite piece of recreational math software, [4D Toys](https://4dtoys.com/). Another student spent several class periods attempting to draw a 4D hexagon, forcing him to struggle productively and stretch his imagination beyond three dimensions. Ultimately, I was inspired to spin off a new elective the following trimester, [Journey to the Fourth Dimension](https://benteachesmath.com/projects%20&%20lessons/journey-to-the-fourth-dimension).

##### ###### Reflect
Here, students listed out all of their favorite scenes from the book, and picked one for their art project. I chose not to limit repeat scenes, and we ended up with about half the class drawing pictures of the 2D rain in Flatland. It was so cool to see how differently they all envisioned it!

##### ###### Transform
This is where we spent the bulk of our time in Illustrating Flatland. After reading the book, wrapping our heads around the mind-bending concepts of interdimensional travel, and reflecting on our favorite scenes from the book, it was time to honor the namesake of the class and... Illustrate Flatland! Britnei took over most of the instruction from here, helping students with design and techniques, while I worked with them on keeping their artwork mathematically sound.

##### ###### Store
At the end of the elective, students shared their artwork in a gallery walk around the classroom. They also literally "stored" it by scanning their pieces and adding them to a digital repository so that they could hang on to their work viritually, and in the future, we can print a picture book.

#### ## Iterations
If I get the chance to run this class again, I would spend more class energy on the social issues. From the book's inherent sexism, to its satire of class hierarchies, there was a lot to unpack that I did not choose to focus on. In particular, I would love to give some students the opportunity to rewrite the role of women and gender in general to better reflect 21st century understanding and values.    
I am also eager to run it again and hopefully get to a point where I can make a high quality physical copy of the book!
