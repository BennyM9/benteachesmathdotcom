This is a self-hosted, self-managed website, and it has been really fun tapping into some of the old skills from my past life at Red Hat, as well as learning a lot of new things along the way. In the modern age of public clouds like AWS, I have decided to kick it old school and host this site on a dead Macbook-turned-Linux-server in my apartment for no better reason than that I thought it would be fun. There are several great reasons NOT to self-host my website, but I am willfully ignoring them.    
While I've put a lot of work into this project, it stands on the backs of some great free and open source technologies, and I need to give credit where it's due!

Unrelated to BenTeachesMath.com, this server is also contributing to the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search ([GIMPS](https://www.mersenne.org/)) by running a fantastic piece of software called [Prime95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime95) which crowdsources compute power for testing for new prime numbers. Mersenne numbers are the set of integers that are one less than a power of two, many of which happen to be prime, such as 7=2<sup>3</sup>-1, 31=2<sup>5</sup>-1 and 524,287=2<sup>19</sup>-1. Since discovering the 35th Mersenne Prime (2<sup>1,398,269</sup>-1) in 1996, GIMPS has found the next 17, many of which broke the previous record for largest prime.
